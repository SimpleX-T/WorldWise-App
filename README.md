# WorldWise

WorldWise is a web application that allows users to keep record of cities around the world they have visited. It provides an interactive map interface where users can view markers for various cities and store information about each one.

## Features

-   **Interactive Map**: Powered by Leaflet.js, the app displays an interactive map where users can pan, zoom, and explore different regions.
-   **City Markers**: Each city is represented by a marker on the map. Clicking on a marker opens a popup with information about that city.
-   **Location Detection**: Users can choose to use their current location as the starting point for the map.
-   **City Information**: The app provides details about each city, such as its name, country, population, and other relevant data.
-   **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

-   **React.js**: The app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Leaflet.js**: The map functionality is implemented using Leaflet.js, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
-   **React Router**: React Router is used for handling client-side routing within the application.
-   **CSS Modules**: The app's styling is implemented using CSS Modules, a modular and scalable approach to writing CSS in React.
